          <h2>About Us</h2>

          <p>
            The accommodation market in Kathmandu is highly saturated yet
            expensive for individual living. We are here to bring you a space
            that is affordable combined with simplicity and quality. We believe
            in strong community building and share a social responsibility
            towards the society. Women wanting to live, study or work in
            Kathmandu can find a safe and affordable place to stay while
            pursuing their dreams. <br />
            We offer a place where you get freedom to live individually and grow
            to become responsible adults. We would love to be a part of your
            wonderful life journey. We aspire to be an integral part and make a
            difference in the lives of the future generation. Our aim is to set
            a benchmark for the basic quality of living standards in hostels for
            students in Kathmandu. To achieve this we have carefully designed
            spaces to cater to the basic need for comfort of our residents.
